Title:
C++ Coding Work

Description:
This is the C++ coding work that I did for my university class. It contains all the short C++ concepts and topics that I learned.

Form.cpp
-> Upon successfully executing the code, it asks for personal information and shows the output.

prod-cal.cpp
-> Upon successful compiling and execution of the code, it asks 2 numbers as input and gives the product of those two numbers.

class-body.txt
-> This is just a boilerplate template of class data structure in c++.
